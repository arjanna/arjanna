- 👋 Hi, I’m @arjanna
- 👀 I’m interested in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate models, high dimensionality data visualization and Rasberry Pi side projects
- 🌱 I’m always up for learning more about Neural Networks/AI applications for climate, GPU code accelleration, Rasberry Pi tricks
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on irrigation/urban parameterization development/porting for numerical models (check out my irrigation parameterization in WRF!)
- 📫 How to reach me: avalmass@uni-bonn.de
